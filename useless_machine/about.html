    <h1 class="quiz"><b>Welcome to the Google Profile Generator</b><br><br>Big companies such as Google are constantly building digital profiles of us, made up of data collected by thousands of trackers in mobile apps and the web. Data brokers then sell this data to whoever is willing to pay the price. It changes hands between countless companies without our knowledge. The data is then sorted into categories we often can’t see and is analyzed by algorithms we often don’t know about – and is then used to make decisions that could impact our lives, for better or worse. But what if <i>we</i> can take control of what kind of person we want to be? What if we can tell these companies who we are?

    <br><br>This website allows you to permeate your search history based on six different behavioral traits. You can tell these companies that you are Wholesome, Destructive, Stupid, Curious, Boring, or Smart by clicking the links generated by the buttons–leaving permanent traces in your search history. A profile is then created for you to gain some insight about your search habits.</h1>
